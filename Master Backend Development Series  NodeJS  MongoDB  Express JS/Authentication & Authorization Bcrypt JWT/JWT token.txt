What is JWT ?
### **What is JWT (JSON Web Token)?** 🔐  

JWT (**JSON Web Token**) is a secure way to transmit authentication data between a client (frontend) and a server (backend). It is mainly used for **user authentication and authorization** in web applications.  

---

### **1️⃣ How JWT Works?**  
1. **User Logs In** → The backend verifies credentials and generates a JWT.  
2. **Token is Sent to the Frontend** → Stored in cookies or localStorage.  
3. **User Makes Requests** → The frontend includes the JWT in API requests.  
4. **Backend Verifies the JWT** → If valid, access is granted; otherwise, it's denied.  

---

### **2️⃣ JWT Structure**  
A JWT consists of three parts:  
1. **Header** → Contains the token type (`JWT`) and algorithm (`HS256`).  
2. **Payload** → Stores user data (e.g., `userID`, `role`).  
3. **Signature** → Ensures the token hasn't been tampered with.

### **3️⃣ Why Use JWT in MERN?**  
✅ **Stateless Authentication** → No need to store sessions on the server.  
✅ **Secure** → Can be signed and verified to prevent unauthorized access.  
✅ **Fast** → Reduces database queries for authentication.

### **4️⃣ Where to Store JWT?**  
- **Cookies (httpOnly)** → Secure, prevents XSS attacks.  
- **LocalStorage** → Less secure, vulnerable to JavaScript attacks.
