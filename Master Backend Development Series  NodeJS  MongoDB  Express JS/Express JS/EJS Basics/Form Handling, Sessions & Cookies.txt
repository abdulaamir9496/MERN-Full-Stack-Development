Form Handling, Sessions & Cookies

form handling and working with the forms
express side and backend side what we have to change ?
if we are using any v8 engine, handle bars, jade, or bug then how to change backend side ?

handle backend process of forms and making sure the data coming from any frontend
lib, fw(framework), templating engines. We still handle it at the backend process.

install cookie parcel.

what is session and cookie ?
in frontend browser whatever stored is called cookie
on the basis of cookie we are connected with server (jo yeh taar hai) we call for this as session

when we remove cookie from frontend
cookie not only help in logging in, it also works like the data stored in my local machine is called cookie
we use cookie majorly in authentication

when we logout the session will be ended.
when we login again new session will be created
from login to logout is been called as 1 session.

If we have to login and get authentication every time we login for that purpose are learning about the session and cookie
we can keep any data in frontend browser.
whenever we request for any data from backend 

we have these 2 lines of code to make it readable to the backend.
app.use(express.json());  //this line of code makes json data readable, convert data to json string and return.
app.use(express.urlencoded({extended: true}));  //convert data to url encoded string and return.

if we remove these either of 2 lines of code, data will not be readable in json format and will not readable in x-www-form-urlencoded
