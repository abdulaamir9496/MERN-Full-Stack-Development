//HTTP protocols:
//How HTTP protocols work ?
//The HTTP protocol is a request-response protocol, which means that the client (usually a web browser)
// sends an HTTP request to the server and the server responds with an HTTP response.

//It is a protocol, which has set of rules which has to be applied/ followed.
//Without following rules, the server will not respond.
//We can't send anything and we cannot receive anything.

Ex: because of HTTP protocol, I am able to see the video on youtube from server, someone has uploaded.
from someone else to server and from server to my local machine?
without HTTP protocol internet will not work. this is also one of the rules.

How to use HTTP protocol?
//To use the HTTP protocol, you need to follow these steps:
//1. Open a web browser (e.g. Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox)
//2. Type the URL of the website you want to visit in the address bar
//3. Press Enter to send the request to the server
//4. The server will respond with the requested data (e.g. HTML, images, videos)
//5. The browser will render the data and display it to you
//6. You can interact with the website by clicking on links, submitting forms, etc.
//7. The browser will send another request to the server to retrieve the requested data
//8. The server will respond with the requested data and the browser will render it.
//9. This process continues until you close the browser.
